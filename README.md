## Website Structure

This is a single-page website with sections for:
- Home/Introduction
- Research 
- Teaching
- Contact

## Deployment Instructions for GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., `username.github.io` for a user site or any repository name for a project site)

2. Initialize the local repository and make your first commit:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/digiuseppe/codingprojects/AcademicWebsite
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial website commit"
   ```

3. Add the GitHub repository as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   ```

4. Push the code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

5. Configure GitHub Pages:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to Settings > Pages
   - For "Source", select "main" branch and save
   - Your site will be published at `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repository-name/`

## Updating the Website

To update your website, you can either:

1. Make changes directly through VSCode, then commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push
   ```

2. Or use GitHub's web interface to edit files directly.

## Customization Tips

- Replace the profile photo placeholder by adding an image file to the project and updating the HTML
- Add your actual publication details in the research section
- Update your course information in the teaching section
- Add any additional sections as needed
